2431974.pdf,to improve feedback and to reserve the red signal for critical events. 2. Dynamic Baseline Updating: • In the Report: The original design mentioned computing a baseline intensity from images taken outside the tunnels but did not explicitly state that the baseline should be updated after each tunnel. • In My Code: I implemented dynamic baseline recalibration after exiting tunnels 1 and 2. For the f

This addition enhances adaptability to varying lighting conditions. 3. User Interface (CLI) Messages: • In the Report: The proposed UI design included a startup screen with clear instructions (e.g., “Press ‘Y’ to Start” and a status screen showing real-time li"
2431974.pdf,"to Start” and a status screen showing real-time light intensity, tunnel detection messages, etc.). • In My Code: While I adhere to a command-line interface that guides the user through starting, terminating, and log display, the exact messages and formatting differ slightly. My code outputs messages about baseline intensity updates, tunnel entry/exit, and log prompts that may not exactly match the"
